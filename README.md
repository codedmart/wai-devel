### wai-devel
[WAI] compliant development server for haskell web frameworks.

### Usage
Works with a fresh yesod scaffold.  
It gives your application a port to listen on via the environment variable PORT.  
Therefore, your application should "get" the environment variable PORT to find a port which it shall listen on.

### Issue
There are no issues. If you find any issues please report.

### Coming next

- Provide a dashboard page with compilation status, GC stats, and other such useful meta-information.
- Port to windows. This depends on ide-backend getting ported to Windows.
